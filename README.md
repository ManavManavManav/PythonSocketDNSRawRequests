# PythonSocketDNSRawRequests

NETiD: mrg225

1. Are there known issues or functions that aren't working currently in your
   attached code? If so, explain. (note that you will get half credit for any reasonably sized bug that is fully explained in the readme)
   
  -The code functions properly unless the answer count exceeds double digits.
   
3. What problems did you face developing code for this project? Around how long did you spend on this project (This helps me decide what I need to explain more clearly for the next projects)

  -Formatting the dns response to get the ips from all answer counts was the most difficult part. I spent around 2-3 hours on this project, majority of it on finding out the subsections i needed to format to extract the required data.
  
4. What interesting thing does you program do to accomplish the task

  -The program works in a very janky way and formats the dns response in a string format.
